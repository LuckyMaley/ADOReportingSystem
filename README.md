# XLookupReportingSystem (XRS)

The XRS automates the traditional method of generating Xlookup tables for ADO reports. It also provides detailed reports on the various contributions of ADOs in their respective modules. The XRS also provides business intelligence reports for relevant stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of the SI programme.

The system is developed using an Asp.net web forms web app in the C# programming language. The Asp.net website also uses the Entity Framework code-first approach to connect and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to the SQL database.
